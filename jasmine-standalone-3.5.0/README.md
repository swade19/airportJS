- I want to instruct a plane to take off from
  an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport


Working on  : 
- everything is broken. Did something to airport class but not sure what. 

-I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy

  Extra Wants : 
  - update to new class style 
  - add front end


  Airport Process : 
  Stopped before weather because I didn't fully understand the code in the walkthrough. 
  Relied on the walkthrough as guidance, but tried to write actual code without looking. 
  Refered to own JS examples made earlier this week for syntax.
